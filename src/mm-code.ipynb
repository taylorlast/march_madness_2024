All game dates have been aligned upon a common scale so that (each year) the Monday championship game of the men's tournament is on DayNum=154. Working backward, the men's national semifinals are always on DayNum=152, the \"play-in\" games are on days 134-135, men's Selection Sunday is on day 132, the final day of the regular season is also day 132, and so on. \n","- **Special note about \"Season\" numbers**: the college basketball season lasts from early November until the national championship tournament that starts in the middle of March. For instance, this year the first regular season games were played in November 2023 and the national championship games will be played in April 2024. Because a basketball season spans two calendar years like this, it can be confusing to refer to the year of the season. By convention, when we identify a particular season, we will reference the year that the season ends in, not the year that it starts in. So for instance, the current season will be identified in our data as the 2024 season, not the 2023 season or the 2023-24 season or the 2023-2024 season, though you may see any of these in everyday use outside of our data.\n","\n","### Questions to consider\n","- Do we want to train the model by making prediction for all games (regular season and post), then only make predictions for tournament games, or do we want to only train on tournament games?\n","\n","### Featues I'd like to add\n","- Quantify guard play\n","- Free throw percentage\n","- Pace\n","- Time of
